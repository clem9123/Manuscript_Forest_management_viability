  abstract = {An algorithm to estimate the parameter values of a transition forest landscape model (MOSAIC) from a gap model (FACET) is presented here. MOSAIC is semi-Markov; it includes random distributed holding times and fixed or deterministic delays in addition to transition probabilities. FACET is a terrain-sensitive version of ZELIG, a spatially explicit gap model. For each topographic class, the input to the algorithm consists of gap model tracer files identifying the cover type of each plot through time. These cover types or states are defined a priori. The method, based on individual plots of the FACET model, requires one FACET run initialized from the “gap” cover type and follows the time history of each plot. The algorithm estimates the transition probability by counting the number of transitions between each pair of states and estimates the fixed lags and the parameters of the probability density functions of the distributed delays by recording the times at which these transitions are made. These density functions are assumed to be Erlang; its two parameters, order and rate, are estimated using a nonlinear least squares procedure. Thus, as output, the algorithm produces four matrices at each terrain class: transition probabilities, fixed delays, and the two parameters for the Erlang distributions. The algorithm is illustrated by its application to two sites, high and low elevation, from the H.J. Andrews Forest in the Oregon Cascades. This scaling-up method helps to bridge the conceptual breach between landscape- and stand-scale models. To reflect landscape heterogeneity, the algorithm can be executed repetitively for many different terrain classes. While the method developed here focuses on FACET and MOSAIC, this general approach could be extended to use other fine-scale models or other forms of meta-models.},

  abstract = {We describe and apply a correspondence between two major modeling approaches to forest dynamics: transition markovian models and gap models or JABOWA-FORET type simulators. A transition model can be derived from a gap model by defining states on the basis of species, functional roles, vertical structure, or other convenient cover types. A gap-size plot can be assigned to one state according to dominance of one of these cover types. A semi-Markov framework is used for the transition model by considering not only the transition probabilities among the states, but also the holding times in each transition. The holding times are considered to be a combination of distributed and fixed time delays. Spatial extensions are possible by considering collections of gap-size plots and the proportions of these plots occupied by each state. The advantages of this approach include: reducing simulation time, analytical guidance to the simulations, direct analytical exploration of hypothesis and the possibility of fast computation from closed-form solutions and formulae. These advantages can be useful in the simulation of landscape dynamics and of species-rich forests, as well as in designing management strategies. A preliminary application to the H. J. Andrews forest in the Oregon Cascades is presented for demonstration.},

But how does this variation affect the outcome of interspecific competition and hence community structure? We derive criteria for the outcome of competition among tree species competing for light, given their allometric and life-history parameters. These criteria are defined in terms of a new simple whole life-cycle measure of performance, which provides a simple way to organize and understand the many ways in which species differ. The general case, in which all parameters can differ between species, can produce coexistence, founder control or competitive exclusion: thus, competition for light need not be hierarchical as implied by R* theory. The special case in which species differ only in crown transmissivity produces neutral dynamics. The special case in which species differ in all parameters except crown transmissivity gives hierarchical competition, where the equivalent of R* is Ẑ*, the height at which trees enter the canopy in an equilibrium monoculture.},

  abstract = {Since Grime's 1973 study on the competitive exclusion of herbaceous plants, ecologists have intensively debated the Biodiversity–Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) relationships for more than 50 years (1973 – the present). Following brief history, I synthesize the major BEF trends, i.e., (1) the shift from quick-growing to long-lasting systems or from grasslands to forests; (2) the shift from species richness to multiple facets of biodiversity; (3) the shift from single ecosystem functions to multifunctionality and stability; (4) the scaling up of BEF relationships across spatiotemporal scales and environmental gradients; (5) the shift from traditional bivariate to advanced multiple multivariate statistical modelling; and (6) approximating BEF-dependent biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. Although the question of how species diversity affects biomass productivity remains unre­ solved, functional trait identity (i.e., the mass ratio effect) is often considered more important than species and trait diversity (i.e., the niche complementarity effect) under the selection effect. Yet, little attention has been paid to exploring how different trophic levels affect BEF outcomes within and across ecosystems under global change which can have important implications for biodiversity conservation that underpins human well-being through ecosystem services. Thus, I summarize the key ecological theories and debated questions, and outline future research directions that can guide us on what is known, unknown known, and unknown in the current global BEF literature. Despite 50 years of debates, several unexplored geographical regions and concepts of ambiguity in BEF research and implications for biodiversity conservation remain to be explored through experiments, natural observations, and remote sensing approaches.},

  abstract = {The degree of general applicability across Europe currently achieved with several forest succession models is assessed, data needs and steps for further model development are identified and the role physiology based models can play in this process is evaluated. To this end, six forest succession models (DISCFORM, ForClim, FORSKA-M, GUESS, PICUS v1.2, SIERRA) are applied to simulate stand structure and species composition at 5 European pristine forest sites in different climatic regions. The models are initialized with site-specific soil information and driven with climate data from nearby weather stations. Predicted species composition and stand structure are compared to inventory data. Similarity and dissimilarity in the model results under current climatic conditions as well as the predicted responses to six climate change scenarios are discussed. All models produce good results in the prediction of the right tree functional types. In about half the cases, the dominating species are predicted correctly under the current climate. Where deviations occur, they often represent a shift of the species spectrum towards more drought tolerant species. Results for climate change scenarios indicate temperature driven changes in the alpine elevational vegetation belts at humid sites and a high sensitivity of forest composition and biomass of boreal and temperate deciduous forests to changes in precipitation as mediated by summer drought. Restricted generality of the models is found insofar as models originally developed for alpine conditions clearly perform better at alpine sites than at boreal sites, and vice versa. We conclude that both the models and the input data need to be improved before the models can be used for a robust evaluation of forest dynamics under climate change scenarios across Europe. Recommendations for model improvements, further model testing and the use of physiology based succession models are made.},

Our goal is for both theoretical and empirical ecologists to be able to use the theory to interpret their findings, and to get a precise sense of the limits of its applicability. To this end, we introduce an explicit handling of limiting factors, and a new way of defining the scaling factors that partition invasion growth rates into the different mechanisms contributing to coexistence. We explain terminology such as relative nonlinearity, storage effect, and growth-density covariance, both in a formal setting and through their biological interpretation. We review the theory's applications and contributions to our current understanding of species coexistence. While the theory is very general, it is not well suited to all problems, so we carefully point out its limitations. Finally, we critique the paradigm of decomposing invasion growth rates into stabilizing and equalizing components: we argue that these concepts are useful when used judiciously, but have often been employed in an overly simplified way to justify false claims.},

With this as a background we discuss how to better manage European forests for both production and biodiversity. We argue that the next generation of forestry practices need to understand and mimic natural disturbance dynamics much better than the present ones. Of particular importance is the fact that most species in European forests have evolved in forests that were to a large extent influenced by large grazers, first by megaherbivores and later, in historic times, by domestic animals. We highlight several areas where new knowledge and management tools are urgently needed: (i) How do species survive and adapt to the natural disturbance regimes in different regions and forest types? (ii) How can new and imaginative forest management practices be devised that take natural disturbance regimes into account? (iii) How does forest biodiversity affect ecosystem function and stability in a changing world, in particular in the light of predicted climate changes? (iv) How are ecological processes at different levels and scales related to diversity, and how do different management practices affect biodiversity? (v) How can efficient agroforestry methods be developed to preserve biodiversity? (vi) What is the role of humans and human behaviour for sustainable management of ecosystems?},

In contrast, at the forest-level, even-aged management, as is currently practised, rarely permits adequate reproduction of the variety of age classes, stand types, and structural components normally found in the boreal forest. A model that allows an even-aged management approach inspired by natural dynamics is proposed.},

  abstract = {Losses of natural and semi-natural forests, mostly to agriculture, are a significant concern for biodiversity. Against this trend, the area of intensively managed plantation forests increases, and there is much debate about the implications for biodiversity. We provide a comprehensive review of the function of plantation forests as habitat compared with other land cover, examine the effects on biodiversity at the landscape scale, and synthesise context-specific effects of plantation forestry on biodiversity. Natural forests are usually more suitable as habitat for a wider range of native forest species than plantation forests but there is abundant evidence that plantation forests can provide valuable habitat, even for some threatened and endangered species, and may contribute to the conservation of biodiversity by various mechanisms. In landscapes where forest is the natural land cover, plantation forests may represent a low-contrast matrix, and afforestation of agricultural land can assist conservation by providing complementary forest habitat, buffering edge effects, and increasing connectivity. In contrast, conversion of natural forests and afforestation of natural non-forest land is detrimental. However, regional deforestation pressure for agricultural development may render plantation forestry a ‘lesser evil’ if forest managers protect indigenous vegetation remnants. We provide numerous context-specific examples and case studies to assist impact assessments of plantation forestry, and we offer a range of management recommendations. This paper also serves as an introduction and background paper to this special issue on the effects of plantation forests on biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Sudden oak death has devastated tree populations across California. However, management might still slow disease spread at local scales. We demonstrate how to unambiguously characterize effective, local management strategies using a detailed, spatially explicit simulation model of spread in a single forest stand. This pre-existing, parameterized simulation is approximated here by a carefully calibrated, non-spatial model, explicitly constructed to be sufficiently simple to allow optimal control theory (OCT) to be applied. By lifting management strategies from the approximate model to the detailed simulation, effective time-dependent controls can be identified. These protect tanoak—a culturally and ecologically important species—while conserving forest biodiversity within a limited budget. We also consider model predictive control, in which both the approximating model and optimal control are repeatedly updated as the epidemic progresses. This allows management which is robust to both parameter uncertainty and systematic differences between simulation and approximate models. Including the costs of disease surveillance then introduces an optimal intensity of surveillance. Our study demonstrates that successful control of sudden oak death is likely to rely on adaptive strategies updated via ongoing surveillance. More broadly, it illustrates how OCT can inform effective real-world management, even when underpinning disease spread models are highly complex.},

Although forests provide essential ecological services, they have been less well investigated. We used dendrochronology to compare the tree radial growth rates of four important timber species in replicated, spatially mapped stands that differed in tree composition and diversity within a central European managed forest. Growth rates differed among species but were largely unaffected by the density of neighbouring trees. Increasing stand diversity enhanced individual growth rates, after accounting for the effects of tree density and size. These increases were statistically indistinguishable among the four species. In contrast, the effects of stand and neighbourhood species composition on growth rates were non-significant. Policy implications. Our study of long-established central European forest stands revealed levels of tree diversity can be increased in managed forests, with the potential for modest increases in tree growth rates. These results suggest that in addition to the biodiversity and risk mitigation benefits associated with shifting practices away from monoculture management, increased carbon sequestration and yields in mature forests are likely to be realized. Our results suggest that it is possible to increase forest diversity with little or no costs to production and even with the potential for modest increases in tree growth rates.},

  abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

  abstract = {A quantitative approach to species coexistence based on the invasibility criterion has led to an appreciation of coexistence mechanisms in terms of stabilizing and equalizing components, but major challenges are the need to consider general multispecies settings, interactions beyond competition, and multiple scales of space and time. Moreover, two essential concepts, species-level average fitness and scaling factors, have not had clear definitions. A general approach to defining average fitnesses and scaling factors is given, along with the origin of stabilizing mechanisms as deviations from a reference model where no coexistence is possible. Illustrations are general Lotka–Volterra models, models accounting specifically for resource use and natural enemies, and models with temporal fluctuations. Community averages of stabilizing mechanisms reveal overall opportunities for coexistence, and define mechanisms more precisely through their formulae. Average fitnesses adjusted for the presence of coexistence mechanisms provide a better definition of equalizing mechanisms. While these ideas apply to the components of invasion rates, permanence theory and stochastic persistence theory show how invasion rates can be used to demonstrate species coexistence in complex settings. Although species coexistence has often focused on competition, detailed models of the roles of natural enemies provide a new perspective on the opportunities for coexistence in nature. The concept of apparent competition recognizes the essential symmetry between density-dependence from resource depletion and from supporting natural enemies. Natural enemy partitioning is the natural analogue of resource partitioning and has an equivalent role in promoting coexistence. Rather than reinforcing each other, however, the strength of coexistence is often intermediate between that implied by resource partitioning alone and that implied by natural enemy partitioning alone, as elucidated by recent Lotka–Volterra theory. Synthesis. Although there are alternative approaches for understanding coexistence in multispecies settings, ideas based on stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms continue to provide new insights. Multiple species and multiple trophic levels are naturally challenging, but the new theories of permanence and stochastic persistence support the critical role of invasion rates in species coexistence, and thus support the understanding to be derived by partitioning invasion rates into average fitness differences and stabilizing components.},

To investigate how distinct species affect ecosystem productivity, we used a forest-gap model to simulate realistic temperate forest successions along an environmental gradient and measured ecosystem productivity at the end of the successional trajectories. We performed 10 560 simulations with different sets and numbers of species, bearing either distinct or indistinct functional traits, and compared them to random assemblages, to mimic the consequences of a regional loss of species. Long-term ecosystem productivity dropped when distinct species were lost first from the regional pool of species, under the harshest environmental conditions. On the contrary, productivity was more dependent on ordinary species in milder environments. Our findings show that species functional distinctiveness, integrating multiple trait dimensions, can capture species-specific effects on ecosystem productivity. In a context of an environmentally changing world, they highlight the need to investigate the role of distinct species in sustaining ecosystem processes, particularly in extreme environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Forests in Central Europe have been used since centuries and were systematically changed by silvicultural practices since the late 1700s. Focusing on possible biodiversity losses, forest stand management primarily impacts on the biodiversity attributes ‘composition, structure and functioning’ that are interlinked and incorporate different organizational and spatial ecosystem levels. Forest stand management can manipulate tree species diversity, which in turn affects stand structure and finally leads to changes in forest functions and services. We used meta-analyses to review 49 papers with 197 comparisons on compositional and structural diversity between unmanaged and managed forests as well as 53 comparisons of biomass productivity between mixed and monoculture forests throughout the temperate biome of Europe. Besides management impacts, for species and structural comparisons, we took time since abandonment of forest stand management into consideration when dealing with unmanaged forests. For species richness and diversity, we could not detect significant management effects; no significant influences of time since abandonment of management could be identified either. Structural attributes partly revealed considerable responses to forest stand management. Importantly, deadwood quantity, the number of microhabitats, and tree size diversity were reduced by forest stand management, while no effect was found for stand basal area and the number of living trees. Some of these effects become more pronounced with increasing time since abandonment. Forest productivity was significantly enhanced by regular moderate thinning compared with untreated stands and by tree species mixing compared with monospecific stands. Based on these results, we discuss the role of direct and indirect silvicultural effects, interactions between biodiversity components, the problem of defining the unmanaged reference state, and perspectives for forest stand management in practice.},

We argue that maximizing biodiversity in managed forest landscapes requires a diversity of forest management regimes in space and time. This will generate high levels of habitat heterogeneity at a landscape scale, which in turn will support various groups of forest species. Based on concepts from landscape ecology, we formulate five hypotheses on how management diversity, i.e. combining various management approaches can benefit overall biodiversity across a production forest landscape. First, management diversity will increase habitat diversity and, therefore, beta diversity (the habitat diversity hypothesis). Second, asynchrony in management timing will enhance long-term availability of different habitat types (the spatio-temporal heterogeneity hypothesis). Third, management to create spatial adjacency or proximity of stands with different management or successional stages will increase biodiversity by providing simultaneous access to multiple resources (the interspersion hypothesis). Fourth, heterogeneous unmanaged set-aside forests, interspersed with managed forests, are needed for complete biodiversity conservation (the natural forest hypothesis). Fifth, management diversity will create functional landscape connectivity between protected forests for multiple species through time (the temporary corridor hypothesis). Although strongly grounded in landscape and forest ecology, these five hypotheses remain largely under-investigated, and we suggest methods for how they can be tested. In the meantime, we suggest that increasing forest management diversity represents a risk-spreading approach for adaptation to global change, and therefore is likely a reasonable objective for sustainable forestry moving forward.},

  abstract = {Tree species mixing of oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl./Quercus robur L.) and pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) has been shown to have positive effects on ecosystem service provision. From a management perspective, however, it is still uncertain which thinning regime provides the highest possible productivity of mixed oak–pine forests in the long term. Because of a lack of empirical studies dealing with thinning and species mixing effects on oak–pine forests, we simulated forest growth in order to test which thinning type and intensity may provide the highest productivity in the long-term. To achieve this, we simulated the growth of pure and mixed stands of oak and pine for 100 years in 23 triplets located on an ecological gradient across Europe. For this purpose, we applied four different growth simulators and compared their results: the distance-independent single-tree simulator PROGNAUS, the distance-dependent single-tree simulator SILVA, the gap model ForCEEPS, and the process-based simulator 3D-CMCC-FEM. We investigated the effects of species mixing and thinning from the upper (thinning from above) and lower tail (thinning from below) of the diameter distribution by reducing the stand basal area to 50 and 80\% of the maximum basal area. We compared simulated results of the relative volume productivity of mixed versus pure stands and of thinned versus unthinned stands to empirical results previously obtained on the same set of triplets. Simulated relative volume productivity ranged between 61 and 156\%, although extremes of 10\% and of 300\% could be observed. We found the relative volume productivity to be influenced by stand age, but not by stand density, except for PROGNAUS. Relative volume productivity did not increase with the site water supply of the triplet location. Highest long-term productivity for oak, pine and oak–pine stands can be expected in consequence of thinning from above, but the effect of thinning intensity differed between simulators. Thinning effects were positively affected by stand density, but not by stand age, except for thinning from above predicted by PROGNAUS. Predicted thinning effects showed good approximation of results from thinning experiments for oak, but not for pine stands. We hypothesize the results might be caused by the insufficient simulator representation of climate and its interaction with other site variables and stand structure. Further work is needed to reduce the revealed limitations of the existing growth models, as we currently see no alternative to such kind of studies and simulators.},

  abstract = {Forests are experiencing an environment that changes much faster than during the past several hundred years. In addition, the abiotic factors determining forest dynamics vary depending on its location. Forest modeling thus faces the new challenge of supporting forest management in the context of environmental change. This review focuses on three types of models that are used in forest management: empirical (EM), process-based (PBM) and hybrid models. Recent approaches may lead to the applicability of empirical models under changing environmental conditions, such as (i) the dynamic state-space approach, or (ii) the development of productivity-environment relationships. Twenty-five process-based models in use in Europe were analyzed in terms of their structure, inputs and outputs having in mind a forest management perspective. Two paths for hybrid modeling were distinguished: (i) coupling of EMs and PBMs by developing signal-transfer environment-productivity functions; (ii) hybrid models with causal structure including both empirical and mechanistic components. Several gaps of knowledge were identified for the three types of models reviewed.},

  abstract = {Through complementarity interactions, mixed-species forests can be more productive than monocultures, and this effect can increase with tree-species richness. However, this is not always the case. This review examines the processes and stand structural attributes that can influence diversity-productivity relationships (DPRs); how they influence resource availability, resource uptake, and resource-use efficiency; and also describes some important differences between tree-diversity versus grassland-diversity experiments. The size of the complementarity effects caused by these processes and stand structures varies along spatial and temporal gradients in resource availability and climate. These spatial and temporal dynamics have now been examined in many studies, and the general patterns are summarized using a simple framework; complementarity is predicted to increase as the availability of resource “X” declines (or climatic condition X becomes harsher) if the species interactions improve the availability, uptake, or use efficiency of resource X (or interactions improve climatic condition X). Importantly, this framework differs from the stress-gradient hypothesis to account for a wider range of inter-specific plant interactions (not only facilitation) by considering contrasting methods used to quantify species interactions while accounting for stand structure. In addition, complementarity (as opposed to facilitation) for a given species combination can increase as growing conditions improve in forests, contrary to predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis with regards to facilitation. This review indicates that while the effects of tree-species diversity on growth and other forest functions are now receiving a lot of attention, far less is known about the effects of structural diversity on growth or forest functioning. Direct measurements of the processes, as opposed to focusing mainly on growth responses, could greatly contribute to our understanding of structural diversity effects.},

The IDH states that diversity of competing species is, or should be expected to be, maximized at intermediate frequencies and/or intensities of disturbance or environmental change. I argue that the IDH has been refuted on both empirical and theoretical grounds, and so should be abandoned. Empirical studies only rarely find the predicted humped diversity–disturbance relationship. Theoretically, the three major mechanisms thought to produce humped diversity–disturbance relationships are logically invalid and do not actually predict what they are thought to predict. Disturbances and other environmental fluctuations can affect diversity, but for different reasons than are commonly recognized.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity conservation is a key objective for sustainable forest management, but the multi-dimensional and multi-scale character of biodiversity renders full assessment difficult at large scale. Therefore, indicators are often used to monitor biodiversity. Important cost-benefit synergies can be achieved if indicators are derived from existing data. In this study, a model for classifying forest stand structures was developed and tested as an indicator of overall plant species diversity at stand level. The model combines four stand structure parameters: canopy coverage, age of canopy trees, tree species composition and canopy stratification. Using data from the National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden and General Linear Mixed Model, plant species diversity (Shannon diversity index, SHDI) and composition (Sørensen-Dice index, SDI) were tested between 26 different stand structure types and nine soil classes. The results showed that mature stands with a stratified canopy had the highest plant species diversity across the soil classes, particularly if they comprised mixed coniferous and broadleaved species with a semi-open canopy. In contrast, young ({$<$}30years) single-layered stands had consistently low species diversity. Of the four stand structure parameters in the model, age of canopy trees was most influential for SHDI value, followed by canopy stratification, tree species composition and canopy coverage. According to the SDI values, different stand structure types represented different species composition regardless of soil class and species diversity (SHDI value). However, most SDI values were higher than 0.5, indicating that fewer than 50\% of the species changed between stand structure types. The stand parameters included in the model can probably be extracted from national forest inventories in many countries and understood without specialist taxonomic knowledge, making the model applicable in practice to support forest management decision-making on enhancing forest biodiversity at stand level.},

  abstract = {A great share of ecosystem services (ES) at the global scale is provided by forest biomes, and acknowledging the value of forest ES is critically important towards sustainable decision making. The literature inventory of forest valuation studies is extensive and thus a significant mass of knowledge is already available concerning the value of forest ES. To this end, meta-analysis is a prominent benefit transfer approach that has been employed in the past to provide value transfers of forest ES taking advantage of contemporary knowledge. For the purposes of conducting a meta-analysis, we collected 158 primary studies, originated in Europe and dated from 2000 to 2017, of which 30 provided relevant information for a statistical meta-analysis, yielding 71 value observations. The results reveal that GDP per capita and the type of ecosystem service are significant determinants in explaining the variation in forest value. We also apply the meta-analysis model results so as to estimate the ES provided by forests in the Czech Republic. We find that the total value of forest is approximately 2842\,US\$\,ha−1\,year−1, with regulation and maintenance ES being the most valuable services. We finally attempt to show the prospects of using this method for accounting purposes and illustrate the supply and use forest accounting tables based on the meta-analysis outcomes. Meta-analysis can potentially form a promising decision support tool for start-up accounts considered as a second best valuation approach. Nonetheless, the method still remains questionable due to the great variation in how primary valuation studies are reported and the lack of guidelines with reference to its application in ecosystem accounting as such.},

  abstract = {Climate models predict an increase in the intensity and frequency of drought episodes in the Northern Hemisphere. Among terrestrial ecosystems, forests will be profoundly impacted by drier climatic conditions, with drastic consequences for the functions and services they supply. Simultaneously, biodiversity is known to support a wide range of forest ecosystem functions and services. However, whether biodiversity also improves the resistance of these ecosystems to drought remains unclear. We compared soil drought exposure levels in a total of 160 forest stands within five major forest types across Europe along a gradient of tree species diversity. We assessed soil drought exposure in each forest stand by calculating the stand-level increase in carbon isotope composition of late wood from a wet to a dry year (Δδ13CS). Δδ13CS exhibited a negative linear relationship with tree species diversity in two forest types, suggesting that species interactions in these forests diminished the drought exposure of the ecosystem. However, the other three forest types were unaffected by tree species diversity. We conclude that higher diversity enhances resistance to drought events only in drought-prone environments. Managing forest ecosystems for high tree species diversity does not necessarily assure improved adaptability to the more severe and frequent drought events predicted for the future.},

  abstract = {The paper provides a conversion regime from even-aged to uneven-aged stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.). The conversion regime was tested by the distance-dependent single-tree simulator SILVA 2.1. The initial data for the simulation and the assumed site productivity were deduced using inventory data of the north Black Forest. The conversion regime was compared to a typical future-tree oriented age–class treatment system. Thereby four variants of the conversion regime, differing in the number and diameter of the ‘regeneration-funnels’ (gaps in the canopy of the stand) which were created during the ‘graded-regeneration-phase’, were compared to a basal-area oriented future-tree age–class treatment. A simulation-run of 110 years — divided into 22 periods of five years — was conducted. The analysis of the simulation-run showed that the possibilities to achieve uneven-aged structures in single-layered, even-aged stands through ‘structuring measures’ during thinning or target–diameter harvesting were very limited. The success of the conversion depended mainly on the success of the regeneration during the conversion. The early creation of ‘regeneration-funnels’ was linked to severe losses in increment and standing volume. As well as influences on different stand-parameters (e.g. stem-distribution) changes in structure-parameters caused by the conversion could be assessed. In particular, the modified Shannon-index did react distinctly to the implementation of the natural regeneration in the regeneration-funnels. Indeed, a steady state was only temporarily reached with the variant with the largest gaps. Finally, the results of the conversion experiment were subject to a critical review. Thus, the limits of the model in its current version and further research needs were discussed.},

Over 300 papers published between 2000 and 2009 reporting MCDA applications in the environmental field were identified through a series of queries in the Web of Science database. The papers were classified by their environmental application area, decision or intervention type. In addition, the papers were also classified by the MCDA methods used in the analysis (analytic hierarchy process, multi-attribute utility theory, and outranking). The results suggest that there is a significant growth in environmental applications of MCDA over the last decade across all environmental application areas. Multiple MCDA tools have been successfully used for environmental applications. Even though the use of the specific methods and tools varies in different application areas and geographic regions, our review of a few papers where several methods were used in parallel with the same problem indicates that recommended course of action does not vary significantly with the method applied.},

  abstract = {The capacity of forests to recover after disturbance, i.e., their resilience, determines their ability to persist and function over time. Many variables, natural and managerial, affect forest resilience. Thus, understanding their effects is critical for the development of sound forest conservation and management strategies, especially in the context of ongoing global environmental changes. We conducted a representative review, meta-analysis, of the forest literature in this topic (search terms “forest AND resilience”). We aimed to identify natural conditions that promote or jeopardize resilience, assess the efficacy of post-disturbance management practices on forest recovery, and evaluate forest resilience under current environmental changes. We surveyed more than 2,500 articles and selected the 156 studies (724 observations) that compared and quantified forest recovery after disturbance under different contexts. Context of recovery included: resource gradients (moisture and fertility), post-disturbance biomass reduction treatments, species richness gradients, incidence of a second disturbance, and disturbance severity. Metrics of recovery varied from individual tree growth and reproduction, to population abundance, to species richness and cover. Analyses show management practices only favored recovery through increased reproduction (seed production) and abundance of recruitment stages. Higher moisture conditions favored recovery, particularly in dry temperate regions; and in boreal forests, this positive effect increased with regional humidity. Biomass reduction treatments were only effective in increasing resilience after a drought. Early recruiting plant stages benefited from increased severity, while disturbance severity was associated with lower recovery of remaining adult trees. This quantitative review provides insight into the natural conditions and management practices under which forest resilience is enhanced and highlights conditions that could jeopardize future resilience. We also identified important knowledge gaps, such as the role of diversity in determining forest resilience and the lack of data in many regions.},

  abstract = {Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is known to be beneficial in biodiversity conservation, but its effects on tree diversity remain unknown. Pattern of tree diversity following disturbance usually varies with spatial scale of sampling (i.e., plot size). We examined the impacts of RIL on species richness and community composition of tree species at different spatial scales, and the scale (plot size) dependency of the two metrics; species richness versus community similarity. One 2-ha and three to four 0.2-ha plots were established in each of primary, RIL, and conventionally logged (CL) forest in Sabah, Malaysia. Species richness (the number of species per unit number of stems) was higher in the RIL than in the CL forest at both scales. The relationship between species richness and logging intensity varied with plot size. Species richness was greater in the RIL than in the primary forest at the 2-ha scale, while it was similar between the two forests at 0.2-ha scale. Similarly, species richness in the CL forest demonstrated a greater value at the 2-ha scale than at the 0.2-ha scale. Greater species richness in the two logged forests at the 2-ha scale is attributable to a greater probability of encountering the species-rich, small patches that are distributed heterogeneously. Community composition of the RIL forest more resembled that of the primary forest than that of the CL forest, regardless of plot size. Accordingly, species richness is a scale-dependent metric, while community similarity is a more robust metric to indicate the response of tree assemblage to anthropogenic disturbance.},

Regarding management issues, mixed stands are considered a relevant option to maintain forest cover and ecosystem services under climate change. However, the possibility to maintain these mixed stands with management actions with positive effects on forest functioning under climate change remains uncertain and deserves further investigations. Relying on a simulation-based study with a forest gap model (ForCEEPS), we thus addressed the following questions: (1) Are monospecific stands vulnerable to climate change? (2) Would mixed stands significantly mitigate climate change effects on forest productivity and wood production under climate change? (3) Would conversion to mixed stand management affect significantly forest productivity and wood production under climate change compare to monospecific management? In this study, we quantified potential climate change effect (using RCP 8.5 and present climate) and management’s effect in the French Alps, focusing on five species (Fagus sylvatica, Abies alba, Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, and Quercus pubescens). We tested different scenarios, with various composition, structure, or environmental conditions, under climate change. These simulations showed that monospecific stands currently growing in stressful conditions would be vulnerable to climate change. Managing mixed stands or conversion from pure to mixed stands would make it possible to maintain higher productivity in the long term than monospecific stands, depending on the species and the sites considered. Our results will feed into discussion on forest management in the context of climate change.},

  abstract = {Despite growing evidence that, on average, diverse forests tend to be more productive than species-poor ones, individual studies often report strongly contrasting relationships between tree species richness and above-ground wood production (AWP). In the attempt to reconcile these apparently inconsistent results, we explored whether the strength and shape of AWP–diversity relationships shifts along spatial and temporal environmental gradients in forests across Europe. We used tree ring data from a network of permanent forest plots distributed at six sites across Europe to estimate annual AWP over a 15-year period (1997–2011). We then tested whether the relationship between tree species richness and AWP changes (i) across sites as a function of large-scale gradients in climatic productivity and tree packing density and (ii) among years within each sites as a result of fluctuating climatic conditions. AWP–species richness relationships varied markedly among sites. As predicted by theory, the relationship shifted from strongly positive at sites where climate imposed a strong limitation on wood production and tree packing densities were low, to weakly negative at sites where climatic conditions for growth were most suitable. In contrast, we found no consistent effect of interannual fluctuations in climate on the strength of AWP–species richness relationships within sites. Synthesis. Our results indicate that the shape and strength of the relationship between tree diversity and forest productivity depends critically on environmental context. Across Europe, tree diversity shows the greatest potential to positively influence forest productivity at either end of the latitudinal gradient, where adverse climatic conditions limit productivity and lead to the development of less densely packed stands.},

All model functions and parameters were derived from permanent plot censuses in a warm-temperate rain forest in southern Japan. The simulated tree densitymean tree size trajectories using species-averaged parameters were similar to those previously reported for even-aged monocultures. An upper boundary of the density-size trajectories or the self-thinning line did not change when the recruitment of seedlings was taken into account. The observed variance of growth rate at a given size hardly affected the results of simulation. A simulation of a multi-species system composed of the three most abundant species showed the same density-size dynamics in terms of total yield as a species-averaged system, while not in terms of each species cohort. It is concluded that the established rules of competition-density effect and self-thinning in higher plants are due to one-sided competition among co-occurring plant individuals of similar life forms irrespective of species.},

  abstract = {Coexistence of tree species is usually explained in relation to horizontal heterogeneity of forests caused by disturbance. In contrast, it remains unknown whether one-sided competition for light in vertically structured forests contributes to stable coexistence of tree species that share the same adult height, even without horizontal heterogeneity. And if so, it is needed to specify the conditions of stable coexistence in terms of demographic and allometric traits between species. To answer these questions, we employ a theoretical model that describes dynamics of tree populations in forests of which vertical structure is expediently divided by height classes. We carry out analytical examination for a forest with two height classes where tree populations are adult in canopy and juvenile in understorey. Demographic processes in the canopy are regulated by foliage density in the canopy, whereas juvenile survival is suppressed by overall foliage density in both classes. A between-species difference in juvenile/adult ratio of foliage density is required for coexistence equilibrium of two species to exist. The difference in juvenile/adult ratio in equilibrium is determined by demographic and allometric parameters of species. Trade-offs between demographic parameters are necessary for a coexistence equilibrium which is either stable or unstable. A species with high fecundity and/or shade-free juvenile survival can stably coexist with a species with high shade-free growth rate and/or adult survival, whereas it cannot stably coexist with a species with high shade tolerance in growth rate and/or in adult survival. Difference in shade tolerance in juvenile survival does not contribute to stable coexistence. Height-foliage allometry contributes only additionally to enhance coexistence equilibrium. When we divide forests into three height classes, up to three species can coexist, by means of demographic trade-offs that bring about interspecific differentiation in vertical foliage distribution. We show all possible cases of coexistence among canopy (C), subcanopy (S) and understorey (U) species in terms of maximum adult height as follows: CCC, CCS, CCU, CSS and CSU. Synthesis. Our theoretical model shows that demographic trade-offs among tree species with identical demographic responses to shade promotes stable coexistence through vertical foliage partitioning. This mechanism works independently of the coexistence mechanism through horizontal partitioning of patch mosaic, which is associated with interspecific difference in shade tolerance.},

  abstract = {A geographically extended model of the dynamics of tree size structure of forests is proposed to simulate the change of forest zonation along latitude in response to global environmental change. To predict the response of forests to global change, it is necessary to construct functional models of forest tree populations. The size-structure-based model requires far less memory and steps of calculation compared with individual-based models, and it is easy to incorporate the dimension of geographic locations into the model to describe large-scale dynamics of forest-type distributions. The effect of increasing size growth rate, expected from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, was diminished at the stand-level basal area density, because of regulation by one-sided competition. Model simulations of a century-long global warming at around 3 °C predicted that (1) biomass changed in resident forests rather simultaneously in response to warming, and that (2) there was a considerable time lag in movement at the boundaries of different forest types, particularly under the existence of resident forest types that would be finally replaced. It required several thousand years after a century-long warming spell for forest types to attain new steady-state distributions after shifting. As a consequence, global warming created a zigzag pattern of biomass distribution along a latitudinal gradient, i.e., an increase in the cooler-side boundary of forest types and a decrease in the warmer-side boundary.},

The strength of the density effect due to one-sided competition for light on a forest tree of a given size is expressed in terms of the cumulative basal area of trees irrespective of species larger than this tree in the forest stand. The model does not assume the existence of species-to-species competition coefficients. Species differences are expressed in terms of potential size growth rate, susceptibility to suppression of size growth rate, mortality and recruitment rate. A one-dimensional drift equation is applied to express the dynamics of the size distributions of species. The model describes successfully secondary succession in an open system (allowing seed inflow from outside the plot). It also yields a stable coexistence in a closed system (without seed inflow) between three representative tree species, though it takes a long time (20000 years) to attain equilibrium.

  abstract = {1 It is an essential feature of plants that leaves at higher levels have better access to light than those at lower levels. Thus, larger plants generally enjoy greater success in competing for light than smaller ones. We analyse the effect of such size-asymmetry, or one-sided competition, on the successful coexistence of plant species, using an analytically tractable model for stratified populations, in which a plant in the same layer exhibits the same crowding effect as any other, irrespective of species. 2 A two-layer population that is reproductive in upper layer and juvenile in lower layer has a uniquely stable (plant-size-weighted) equilibrium density, as long as its fecundity is sufficient to compensate for its mortality rate. We also calculate a unique threshold lower-layer density of this layered population when there is no upper-layer plant. This threshold lower-layer density is larger than the weighted equilibrium density with upper layer, except for the case of perfect two-sided competition. 3 A two-layer species can stably coexist with a one-layer, understorey species as a result of one-sided, but not two-sided competition. The coexistence condition is that the equilibrium density of the one-layer species lies between the threshold lower-layer density and the equilibrium density of the two-layer species. For an understorey species to coexist successfully with a two-layer species, any advantage in demographic performance, most prominently in a sufficiently high fecundity per plant must offset the disadvantage of living in dark conditions. 4 Results from a model of multi-layer populations suggest that several species differing in terms of maximum layer and fecundity can coexist under conditions of one-sided competition. We demonstrate an example of the stable coexistence of eight species. The inter-specific trade-offs predicted by the model correspond to patterns observed in a rain forest. 5 Synthesis. We propose a stratification theory that explains the generation and maintenance of the successful coexistence of plant species. Under the condition of one-sided competition, a canopy population that takes advantage of escaping from understorey competition shows an ability to invade an understorey with a density higher than its own equilibrium density, and which offers opportunities for an understorey population with high fecundity and/or shade tolerance to coexist. The predicted coexistence of species that share maximum canopy height is most pronounced for trees of tropical rain forests.},

  abstract = {Developing adaptation measures in forestry is an urgent task because the forests regenerated today will have to cope with climate conditions that may drastically change during the life of the trees in the stand. This paper presents a comprehensive review of potential adaptation options in forestry in Europe based on three pillars: a review of the scientific literature, an analysis of current national response strategies, and an expert assessment based on a database compiled in the COST Action ECHOES (Expected Climate Change and Options for European Silviculture). The adaptation measures include responses to both risks and opportunities created by climate change and address all stages of forestry operations. Measures targeted to reduce vulnerability to climate change may either aim to reduce forest sensitivity to adverse climate change impacts or increase adaptive capacity to cope with the changing environmental conditions. Adaptation measures mitigating drought and fire risk such as selection of more drought resistant species and genotypes are crucial. For adaptation to be successful it is of the utmost importance to disseminate the knowledge of suitable adaptation measures to all decision makers from the practice to the policy level. The analysis of the ECHOES database demonstrates that this challenge is well recognized in many European countries. Uncertainty about the full extent of climate change impacts and the suitability of adaptation measures creates a need for monitoring and further research. A better understanding of how to increase adaptive capacity is also needed, as well as regional vulnerability assessments which are crucial for targeting planned adaptation measures.},

  abstract = {In the context of sustainable forest management and climate change, increasing tree richness has been proposed as a possible strategy to reach both ecological and productivity goals. This review focuses on the effects of mixed stands and increasing tree richness on soil fauna in temperate forests. Effects on earthworm and microarthropod (Collembola and Oribatid Mites) species diversity and abundance and community structure are examined, and clues to the main factors affecting soil communities in these stands are proposed. Our statistical analyses showed no evidence of any general trend for the effect of mixture either on earthworm or microarthropod diversity or on their abundance. Indeed, positive, negative and non-significant effects have all been reported. Nevertheless, the majority of the studies did find that increased tree richness or the introduction of broad-leaves had a positive effect. In addition, our review shows that soil organism abundance and diversity can be strongly affected by the presence of certain tree species and that the soil organism community structure is, in most cases, significantly affected by an increase in tree richness or by a mixing effect. Litter features appear to be important drivers of soil fauna community composition, while mixture effect seems to have less impact on soil biota. Soil fauna are directly affected by the physical characteristics (microhabitats) and chemical composition (resource quality) of the litter specific to each tree species. Soil communities are then indirectly affected by the subsequent humus characteristics. We conclude our review with some guidelines for forest management and further research.},

  abstract = {Global forest area is declining rapidly, along with degradation of the ecological condition of remaining forests. Hence it is necessary to adopt forest management approaches that can achieve a balance between (1) human management designs based on homogenization of forest structure to efficiently deliver economic values and (2) naturally emerging self-organized ecosystem dynamics that foster heterogeneity, biodiversity, resilience and adaptive capacity. Natural disturbance-based management is suggested to provide such an approach. It is grounded on the premise that disturbance is a key process maintaining diversity of ecosystem structures, species and functions, and adaptive and evolutionary potential, which functionally link to sustainability of ecosystem services supporting human well-being. We review the development, ecological and evolutionary foundations and applications of natural disturbance-based forest management. With emphasis on boreal forests, we compare this approach with two mainstream approaches to sustainable forest management, retention and continuous-cover forestry. Compared with these approaches, natural disturbance-based management provides a more comprehensive framework, which is compatible with current understanding of multiple-scale ecological processes and structures, which underlie biodiversity, resilience and adaptive potential of forest ecosystems. We conclude that natural disturbance-based management provides a comprehensive ecosystem-based framework for managing forests for human needs of commodity production and immaterial values, while maintaining forest health in the rapidly changing global environment.},

  abstract = {In Fennoscandia, use of the natural forest as a reference for  restoration and management of forest biodiversity has been widely  accepted. However, limited understanding of the structure and dynamics  of the natural forest has hampered the applications of the natural  variability approach. This is especially the case in areas, where the  natural forests have almost totally vanished. This review was motivated  by the idea that despite these difficulties the essential features of  the natural forest can be reconstructed based on biological archives,  historical documents, research done in adjacent natural areas, and  modeling. First, a conceptual framework for analyzing the relationship  between forest structure, dynamics and biodiversity is presented.  Second, the current understanding of the structure and dynamics of  natural forests at different spatiotemporal scales in boreal  Fennoscandia is reviewed. Third, the implications of this knowledge, and  gaps in knowledge, on research and on practical restoration and  management methods aimed at forest biodiversity conservation are  discussed. In conclusion, naturally dynamic forest landscapes are  complex, multiscaled hierarchical systems. Current forest management  methods create disturbance and successional dynamics that are strongly  scale-limited when compared with the natural forest. To restore some of  the essential characteristics of the natural forest’s multiscale  heterogeneity, diversification of silvicultural and harvesting  treatments, as guided by natural disturbance dynamics, is needed to  produce more variation in disturbance severity, quality, extent, and  repeatability.},

  abstract = {The process-based model 4C (FORESEE) has been developed over the past 20 years to study climate impacts on forests and is now freely available as an open-source tool. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive description of this 4C version (v2.2) for scientific users of the model and to present an evaluation of 4C at four different forest sites across Europe. The evaluation focuses on forest growth as well as carbon (net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production), water (actual evapotranspiration, soil water content), and heat fluxes (soil temperature) using data from the PROFOUND database. We applied different evaluation metrics and compared the daily, monthly, and annual variability of observed and simulated values. The ability to reproduce forest growth (stem diameter and biomass) differs from site to site and is best for a pine stand in Germany (Peitz, model efficiency ME=0.98). 4C is able to reproduce soil temperature at different depths in Sorø and Hyytiälä with good accuracy (for all soil depths ME\&thinsp;\&gt;\&thinsp;0.8). The dynamics in simulating carbon and water fluxes are well captured on daily and monthly timescales (0.51\&thinsp;\&lt;\&thinsp;ME\&thinsp;\&lt;\&thinsp;0.983) but less so on an annual timescale (ME\&thinsp;\&lt;\&thinsp;0). This model–data mismatch is possibly due to the accumulation of errors because of processes that are missing or represented in a very general way in 4C but not with enough specific detail to cover strong, site-specific dependencies such as ground vegetation growth. These processes need to be further elaborated to improve the projections of climate change on forests. We conclude that, despite shortcomings, 4C is widely applicable, reliable, and therefore ready to be released to the scientific community to use and further develop the model.},

  abstract = {Global climate change may be affecting forests around the world. However, the impact of climate change on forest population dynamics, especially at the landscape or regional level, has hardly been addressed before. A new methodology was proposed to enable matrix transition models to account for climate impact on forest population dynamics. The first climate-sensitive matrix (CSMatrix) model was developed for the Alaska boreal forest based on observations from over 15years of forest inventory. The spatially explicit model was used to map climate-induced forest population dynamics across the region. The model predicted that the basal area increment in the region under natural succession would be hindered by global warming, more so for dry upland areas than for moist wetlands. It was suggested that temperature-induced drought stress could more than offset a predicted increase of future precipitation in the region to lower overall forest productivity. At the same time, stand diversity would increase across the region through transient species redistribution. Accounting for climate conditions made the CSMatrix model more accurate than conventional matrix models.},

Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in forest productivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial forest productivity alone—US\$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our estimation—is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global conservation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of biodiversity values, forest management strategies, and conservation priorities.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The conservation of biological diversity has become one of the important goals of managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. Ecologists and forest resource managers need measures to judge the success or failure of management regimes designed to sustain biological diversity. The relationships between potential indicator species and total biodiversity are not well established. Carefully designed studies are required to test relationships between the presence and abundance of potential indicator species and other taxa and the maintenance of critical ecosystem processes in forests. Other indicators of biological diversity in forests, in addition or as alternatives to indicator species, include what we call structure-based indicators. These are stand-level and landscape-level (spatial) features of forests such as stand structural complexity and plant species composition, connectivity, and heterogeneity. Although the adoption of practices to sustain (or recreate) key characteristics of forest ecosystems appear intuitively sensible and broadly consistent with current knowledge, information is lacking to determine whether such stand- and landscape-level features of forests will serve as successful indices of (and help conserve) biodiversity. Given our limited knowledge of both indicator species and structure-based indicators, we advocate the following four approaches to enhance biodiversity conservation in forests: (1) establish biodiversity priority areas (e.g., reserves) managed primarily for the conservation of biological diversity; (2) within production forests, apply structure-based indicators including structural complexity, connectivity, and heterogeneity; (3) using multiple conservation strategies at multiple spatial scales, spread out risk in wood production forests; and (4) adopt an adaptive management approach to test the validity of structure-based indices of biological diversity by treating management practices as experiments. These approaches would aim to provide new knowledge to managers and improve the effectiveness of current management strategies.},

  abstract = {Landscape patterns result from complex endogenous dynamics and heterogeneity of environmental drivers. Landscape models are appropriate tools for analysing such patterns. We present the dynamic, spatially explicit, grid-based and spatially linked forest-landscape model TreeMig. In each grid cell, the forest dynamics is simulated with a multi-species, height structured forest model, based on growth, competition and death of the trees in each height class. Within-cell heterogeneity is accounted for by assuming that trees are randomly distributed resulting in Poisson distributions of tree densities and light. Reproduction is modelled explicitly by seed production, seed bank dynamics, germination and sapling development. The forests in the different cells interact spatially through seed dispersal. The model is flexible and can be applied on a range of spatial scales, from single stands to entire regions. The model's ability to generate patterns was tested in two case studies with different spatial resolutions. The first case study shows simulations of pattern formation by endogenous dynamics on a small spatial scale. The simulations are conducted under spatially and temporally homogenous environmental conditions, initialized with seeds of all species in the centre cell. The simulation shows transiently several types of patterns in the species biomasses: circular standing waves, patch structures and homogenous spread of dominant species. In the second, large-scale case study, the tree species’ spread since the last Ice Age in the Alpine region of the Valais is simulated, under temporally and spatially heterogeneous environmental conditions. The simulated spatio-temporal pattern consists of immigration waves of new species into empty or already forested areas, fast die-backs after sharp, strong temperature decreases, slower recolonization after temperature increases and spatial separation of the species according to the environmental conditions. The simulation indicates that the environment forms the basis for the endogenous dynamics, primarily migration and competition, which play a particular role during the transient phases after drastic changes in the boundary conditions (immigration and climate change). We conclude that the forest-landscape model TreeMig is able to produce landscape patterns resulting from both, endogenous dynamics and exogenous drivers and is suitable for a range of different applications.},

The forest model DisCForM scales an individual based, stochastic forest patch model up to a height structured tree population model. To describe the variability arising from stochastic processes in the patch model, DisCForM uses theoretical random dispersions of trees in each height class over all patches. This yields a spatial distribution of light and consequently of light dependent process rates. Three major influences of variability on simulations are examined: site condition, patch to patch, and temporal environmental variability. Simulation studies and comparison with forest compositions from the Swiss National Forest Inventory reveal that these influences affect simulated forest dynamics, species composition, and biodiversity, depending on climatic boundary conditions and hence have to be taken into account in modeling.},

  abstract = {Disturbance is often cited as one of the main factors determining patterns of species diversity. Several models have predicted qualitatively that species richness should be highest at intermediate intensities and/or frequencies of disturbances, but none indicate whether this effect should be strong (statistically accounting for much variability in diversity) or only subtle. Empirical evidence on the point is very mixed. This study examines Markov models of the dynamics of six real communities. We derive the predicted changes in species richness and evenness when these communities are subjected to quantified disturbance frequency and intensity gradients. We also use several different sampling intensities (i.e. numbers of individuals counted) to determine how this affects richness-disturbance relationships. Our models predict that peaked responses of diversity to disturbance should be less common than monotonic ones. Species richness should vary, on average, by only 3\% over gradients of no disturbance to complete disturbance. In the most extreme case, richness varied two-fold over this gradient. Moreover, richness may increase monotonically, decrease monotonically, or be a peaked function of disturbance, interacting in a non-intuitive fashion with both the sampling intensity and the community in question. These results are broadly consistent with a review of published richness-disturbance relationships. Evenness varies somewhat more strongly along disturbance gradients, but the effect is still small. We conclude that extant models provide little reason to believe that disturbance should play more than a subtle role in determining patterns of diversity in nature, contrary to most contemporary literature.},

  abstract = {Mixedwood stands are composed of hardwoods and softwoods, with neither comprising greater than 75\%–80\% of basal area or aboveground biomass. By conferring associational resistance and greater resilience to forests when stressed or disturbed, the more diverse composition of mixedwood stands contributes to forest health. We analyzed three examples where mixedwood stands are more resistant to insect infestations in eastern North America. In balsam fir (Abies balsamea L. Mill.) and spruce (Picea spp.) forests, susceptibility and vulnerability to spruce budworm infestations is reduced with increasing hardwood density. In mid-Atlantic oak-dominated forests, oak mortality following gypsy moth infestations was much greater in oak-dominated forests than in oak–pine mixedwoods, while pine mortality during southern pine beetle infestations was greater in pine-dominated forests than in oak–pine mixedwoods. Overall, mixedwood stands have greater resistance to infestations of defoliators and bark beetles and recover more rapidly from disturbances, reducing economic losses associated with tree mortality and mitigating short-term impacts to ecosystem functioning resulting from insect damage, especially carbon sequestration. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities for mixedwood management to minimize insect damage. Management strategies that incorporate mixedwood stands may provide better continuity in supply of forest products and ecosystem services in the face of projected increases in insect infestations associated with changing climate.},

  abstract = {Criteria and indicators (C \& I) to evaluate the sustainability of forest management have been proposed by the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe. Although primarily defined at the national scale, these C \& I also have implications at scales ranging from forest stands to the forest management unit. In this paper, we review existing forest growth and ecosystem models from the point of view of applicability to prediction of indicators of sustainable management, focusing on stand scale models and management. To do this, we first present a conceptual framework for understanding the role of models in assessing forest management at the stand level in the context of sustainability criteria and indicators. We classify the criteria into those predictable using models operating at the stand scale, and those derivable either through scaling up or as solutions of a multi-objective management optimisation problem. We conclude that to date, no comprehensive models exist that could be used to predict all the indicators simultaneously. The most promising approach seems to be a modular system where different models are combined and run simultaneously, with shared inputs and well defined mutual links. More modelling efforts are needed especially regarding the state of the soil, including carbon, nitrogen and water balances and physical effects. Models also need development in their ability to deal with heterogeneous stand structures and with non-woody forest products such as berries, mushrooms or cork. The outputs of the models need to be developed in a direction where they can be interpreted in terms of the recreational or biodiversity value of the forest. Data requirements are most pronounced on the same issues as the gaps in model availability. It would be important to consider amending the national forest inventories and other similar standard data collection protocols with variables required for sustainability assessment. Importantly, combining different models in a modular system and with variable data sources requires advanced model parameterisation and evaluation methods and assessment of parameter and model uncertainty. The probabilistic, Bayesian approaches hold a lot of promise in this respect. Predictions using several different models or model systems, with systematic analysis of e.g. inter-model variability, could also be considered.},

  abstract = {The problem of scale has been a critical impediment to incorporating important fine-scale processes into global ecosystem models. Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements, ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model, which we label the ecosystem demography model (ED). We then introduce a general method for scaling stochastic individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such as ED to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the occurrence of these events, we derive a size- and age-structured (SAS) approximation for the first moment of the stochastic ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to make predictions about the large scales of interest from a description of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic processes without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use the SAS approximation to implement our individual-based biosphere model over South America from 15° N to 15° S, showing that the SAS equations are accurate across a range of environmental conditions and resulting ecosystem types. We then compare the predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in governing large-scale ecosystem function, showing how population and community-level processes influence ecosystem composition and structure, patterns of aboveground carbon accumulation, and net ecosystem production.},

There are few robust tools available to link these processes, which precludes accurate projections and recommendations for long‐term forest management. Forest gap models present a balance between complexity and generality and are widely used in predictive forest ecology. However, their relevance to tackle questions about the links between species composition, climate and forest functioning is unclear. In this regard, demonstrating the ability of gap models to predict the growth of forest stands at the annual parameterization scale resolution—representing a sensitive and integrated signal of tree functioning and mortality risk—appears as a fundamental step.                                                     In this study, we aimed at assessing the ability of a gap model to accurately predict forest growth in the short term and potential community composition in the long term, across a wide range of species and environmental conditions. To do so, we present the gap model ForCEEPS, calibrated using an original parameterization procedure for the main tree species in France.                                                     ForCEEPS was shown to satisfactorily predict forest annual growth (averaged over a few years) at the plot level from mountain to Mediterranean climates, regardless of the species. Such an accuracy was not gained at the cost of losing precision for long‐term predictions, as the model showed a strong ability to predict potential community compositions. The mechanistic relevance of ForCEEPS parameterization was explored by showing the congruence between the values of key model parameter and species functional traits.                                                     We further showed that accounting for the spatial configuration of crowns within forest stands, the effects of climatic constraints and the variability of shade tolerances in the species community are all crucial to better predict short‐term productivity with gap models.                                                                          Synthesis                     . The dual ability of predicting short‐term functioning and long‐term community composition, as well as the balance between generality and realism (i.e. predicting accuracy) of the new generation of gap models may open great perspectives for the exploration of the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, species coexistence mechanisms and the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems.

Il existe en effet peu d'outils robustes permettant de relier ces processus, ce qui empêche d'établir des projections et des recommandations précises, en particulier pour la gestion forestière à long terme. Les modèles de trouées (                     gap models                     ) se caractérisent par un équilibre entre complexité et généralité, tout en étant largement utilisés en écologie forestière prédictive. Toutefois, leur pertinence pour aborder les questions relatives aux liens entre composition des espèces, climat et fonctionnement des forêts n'est pas clairement établie. Ainsi la démonstration de la capacité des modèles de trouées à prédire la croissance des peuplements forestiers à l'échelle annuelle—représentant un signal sensible et intégré du fonctionnement des arbres et du risque de mortalité—apparaît comme une étape fondamentale.                                                                        Dans cette étude, nous avons cherché à évaluer la capacité d'un modèle de trouées à prédire avec précision à la fois la croissance des forêts à court terme et la composition potentielle des communautés à long terme, pour un large éventail d'espèces et de conditions environnementales. Pour ce faire, nous présentons le modèle ForCEEPS, calibré selon une procédure de paramétrage originale pour les principales essences d'arbres en France.                                                     Nos résultats montrent que ForCEEPS permet de prédire de manière satisfaisante la croissance annuelle des forêts (en moyenne sur quelques années) au niveau de la parcelle, du climat montagnard au climat méditerranéen, quelle que soit l'essence considérée. Une telle précision n'a pas engender de perte de précision pour les prévisions à long terme, car le modèle a montré une bonne capacité à prévoir les compositions potentielles des communautés. De plus, la pertinence de la paramétrisation de ForCEEPS en termes de mécanismes a été explorée en montrant la congruence entre les valeurs des paramètres‐clés du modèle et les traits fonctionnels des espèces.                                                     Nous avons en outre montré que la prise en compte de la configuration spatiale des couronnes dans les peuplements forestiers, de l'effet des contraintes climatiques et de la variabilité des valeurs de tolérances à l'ombre dans les communautés sont cruciales pour mieux prédire la productivité à court terme avec un tel modèle.                                                                          Synthèse                     . La double capacité de prédire le fonctionnement à court terme et la composition de la communauté à long terme, ainsi que l'équilibre entre généralité et réalisme d'une nouvelle génération de modèles de trouées ouvre de grandes perspectives pour explorer les relations entre la biodiversité et le fonctionnement des écosystèmes, étudier les mécanismes de coexistence des espèces à l'échelle local, et prédire les impacts du changement climatique sur les écosystèmes forestiers.},

  abstract = {In this exploratory study, we show how combining the strength of tree diversity experiment with the long-term perspective offered by forest gap models allows testing the mixture yielding behavior across a full rotation period. Our results on a SW France example illustrate how mixing maritime pine with birch may produce an overyielding (i.e., a positive net biodiversity effect). Understanding the link between tree diversity and stand productivity is a key issue at a time when new forest management methods are investigated to improve carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. Well-controlled tree diversity experiments have been set up over the last decades, but they are still too young to yield relevant results from a long-term perspective. Alternatively, forest gap models appear as appropriate tools to study the link between diversity and productivity as they can simulate mixed forest growth over an entire forestry cycle. We aimed at testing whether a forest gap model could first reproduce the results from a tree diversity experiment, using its plantation design as input, and then predict the species mixing effect on productivity and biomass in the long term. Here, we used data from different forest experimental networks to calibrate the gap model ForCEEPS for young pine (Pinus pinaster) and birch (Betula pendula) stands. Then, we used the refined model to compare the productivity of pure and mixed pine and birch stands over a 50-year cycle. The mixing effect was tested for two plantation designs, i.e., species substitution and species addition, and at two tree densities. Regarding the comparison with the experiment ORPHEE (thus on the short term), the model well reproduced the species interactions observed in the mixed stands. Simulations showed an overyielding (i.e., a positive net biodiversity effect) in pine-birch mixtures in all cases and during the full rotation period. A transgressive overyielding was detected in mixtures resulting from birch addition to pine stands at low density. These results were mainly due to a positive mixing effect on pine growth being larger than the negative effect on birch growth. Although this study remains explorative, calibrating gap models with data from monospecific stands and validating with data from the manipulative tree diversity experiment (ORPHEE) offers a powerful tool for further investigation of the productivity of forest mixtures. Improving our understanding of how abiotic and biotic factors, including diversity, influence the functioning of forest ecosystems should help to reconsider new forest managements optimizing ecosystem services.},

The coexistence of coniferous (mostly Abies homolepis) and broad-leaved tree species (mostly Fagus crenata) in a mixed temperate old-growth forest in Japan was simulated by a size-structure dynamics model incorporating the asymmetrical (one-sided) effect of shading between these two life-form guilds. The model assumes that the crowding effect due to one-sided competition for light on a tree of a given size regulates the rate of size growth and recruitment. The cumulative basal area of trees larger than a given tree in the forest is employed to express the intensity of one-sided competition on that tree. Cumulative basal areas of both guilds negatively affected the growth rate of any tree. The shading effect by conifers on the growth rate of either guild was stronger than that by broad-leaved species. Two types of model were tested for recruitment; an additive and a reciprocal model. A reciprocal model, where basal area density of conifers and broad-leaved species has a negative effect on the recruitment of its own guild but has a positive effect on that of the other guild, fit the observed data better than an additive model where total basal area of the two guilds suppresses recruitment rates. Simulations using these models showed that, within a particular range of the set of recruitment rates, the two guilds could coexist. The tendency for reciprocal replacement, incorporated in the reciprocal model, substantially widened the range of coexistence and shortened the time required for convergence.},

The calculations presented are based on species composition, spatial pattern as well as diameter and height distribution. The data assessed are suitable to calculate different measures of structural diversity, if a mapping of the stands is carried out. A comparison of the different indices by means of correlation analysis shows that there exist only few and weak correlations between species diversity of different vegetation layers, and between plant species diversity and diversity of stand structure, while among all the indices of stand structure a correlation exists. More complex indices of stand diversity perform quite well in characterising the specific situation. Mountain forests are compared with forests from lower elevations. They show a tendency towards irregular stand structures. No correlation between the naturalness of tree species composition and the calculated diversity indices can be found within the sample.},

  abstract = {With an increasing pressure on forested landscapes, conservation areas may fail to maintain biodiversity if they are not supported by the surrounding managed forest matrix. Worldwide, forests are managed by one of two broad approaches—even- and uneven-aged silviculture. In recent decades, there has been rising public pressure against the systematic use of even-aged silviculture (especially clear-cutting) because of its perceived negative esthetic and ecological impacts. This led to an increased interest for uneven-aged silviculture. However, to date, there has been no worldwide ecological comparison of the two approaches, based on multiple indicators. Overall, for the 99 combinations of properties or processes verified (one study may have evaluated more than one property or process), we found nineteen (23) combinations that clearly showed uneven-aged silviculture improved the evaluated metrics compared to even-aged silviculture, eleven (16) combinations that showed the opposite, and 60 combinations that were equivocal. Furthermore, many studies were based on a limited study design without either a timescale (44 of the 76) or spatial (54 of the 76) scale consideration. Current views that uneven-aged silviculture is better suited than even-aged silviculture for maintaining ecological diversity and processes are not substantiated by our analyses. Our review, by studying a large range of indicators and many different taxonomic groups, also clearly demonstrates that no single approach can be relied on and that both approaches are needed to ensure a greater number of positive impacts. Moreover, the review clearly highlights the importance of maintaining protected areas as some taxonomic groups were found to be negatively affected no matter the management approach used. Finally, our review points to a lack of knowledge for determining the use of even- or uneven-aged silviculture in terms of both their respective proportion in the landscape and their spatial agency.},

This will require an extended time as managers partition the cut of original trees in periodically establishing new age classes and maintaining the vigor of ones that develop. Strategies might include forms of uniform partial cutting, or patch cutting combined with thinning. The approach depends upon the shade tolerance and regeneration potential of the component species. Also, the limited growth potential of original trees that occupied poor crown positions will force landowners to rely on the dominants and co-dominants as residual growing stock during the conversion of most even-aged stands. Stratified mixed-species stands would allow a different approach. While experience suggests some clear options for the first entry towards conversion, later cuttings are more difficult to envision at present.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Past and present pressures on forest resources have led to a drastic decrease in the surface area of unmanaged forests in Europe. Changes in forest structure, composition, and dynamics inevitably lead to changes in the biodiversity of forest-dwelling species. The possible biodiversity gains and losses due to forest management (i.e., anthropogenic pressures related to direct forest resource use), however, have never been assessed at a pan-European scale. We used meta-analysis to review 49 published papers containing 120 individual comparisons of species richness between unmanaged and managed forests throughout Europe. We explored the response of different taxonomic groups and the variability of their response with respect to time since abandonment and intensity of forest management. Species richness was slightly higher in unmanaged than in managed forests. Species dependent on forest cover continuity, deadwood, and large trees (bryophytes, lichens, fungi, saproxylic beetles) and carabids were negatively affected by forest management. In contrast, vascular plant species were favored. The response for birds was heterogeneous and probably depended more on factors such as landscape patterns. The global difference in species richness between unmanaged and managed forests increased with time since abandonment and indicated a gradual recovery of biodiversity. Clearcut forests in which the composition of tree species changed had the strongest effect on species richness, but the effects of different types of management on taxa could not be assessed in a robust way because of low numbers of replications in the management-intensity classes. Our results show that some taxa are more affected by forestry than others, but there is a need for research into poorly studied species groups in Europe and in particular locations. Our meta-analysis supports the need for a coordinated European research network to study and monitor the biodiversity of different taxa in managed and unmanaged forests.},

These benefits will become even more important with climate change, especially with most humans now living in cities. Yet urban trees are themselves threatened by the changing climate, unprecedented urban growth and new exotic pests and diseases. Hence, to maintain the services provided by urban forests, developing efficient tree management practices aimed at minimizing the risk of catastrophic tree mortality becomes ever more important. Traditional practices often promote low-diversity tree communities to meet the demands of a taxing urban environment and the preferences of citizens. However, these low-diversity communities are inherently more susceptible to collapse. Here we present an intuitively simple and user-friendly urban tree management approach that integrates the latest advances in functional ecology to minimize the risk of catastrophic urban tree mortality caused by future uncertain environmental conditions in order to maintain forest cover and preserve urban ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {For millennia, societies have tried to find ways to sustain people's livelihoods by setting rules to equitably and sustainably access, harvest and manage common pools of resources (CPR) that are productive and rich in species. But what are the elements that explain historical successes and failures? Elinor Ostrom suggested that it depends on at least eight axiomatic principles of good governance, whereas empirical results suggest that these principles are not sufficient to describe them, especially when applied to CPRs that possess great social and ecological diversity. The aim of this article is to explore the behavior of a mathematical model of multi-species forest dynamics that respects the foundations of ecology and Ostrom's governance theory, in order to detect possible constraints inherent to the functioning of these complex systems. The model reveals that fundamental structural laws of compatibilities between species life-history traits are indeed constraining the level of co-existence (average and variance) between a diversity of co-vulnerable timber resource users (RU) and of competing tree species. These structural constraints can also lead to unexpected outcomes. For instance in wetter forest commons, opening up the access to as many diverse RUs as there are competing tree species, produces a diversity of independently-controlled disturbances on species, collectively improving the chances of coexistence between species with different life-history traits. Similar benefits are observed on forest carbon and on profits from timber harvesting. However in drier forest commons, the same benefits cannot be observed, as predicted on the basis of the constraining laws. The results show that the successes and failures of certain management strategies can be reasonably explained by simple mechanistic theories from ecology and the social-ecological sciences, which are themselves constrained by fundamental ecological invariants. If corroborated, the results could be used, in conjunction with Ostrom's CPR theory, to understand and solve various human-nature coexistence dilemmas in complex social-ecological systems.},

  abstract = {Regrowing forests on cleared land is a key strategy to achieve both biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation globally. Maximizing these co-benefits, however, remains theoretically and technically challenging because of the complex relationship between carbon sequestration and biodiversity in forests, the strong influence of climate variability and landscape position on forest development, the large number of restoration strategies possible, and long time-frames needed to declare success. Through the synthesis of three decades of knowledge on forest dynamics and plant functional traits combined with decision science, we demonstrate that we cannot always maximize carbon sequestration by simply increasing the functional trait diversity of trees planted. The relationships between plant functional diversity, carbon sequestration rates above ground and in the soil are dependent on climate and landscape positions. We show how to manage ‘identities’ and ‘complementarities’ between plant functional traits to achieve systematically maximal cobenefits in various climate and landscape contexts. We provide examples of optimal planting and thinning rules that satisfy this ecological strategy and guide the restoration of forests that are rich in both carbon and plant functional diversity. Our framework provides the first mechanistic approach for generating decision-makingrules that can be used to manage forests for multiple objectives, and supports joined carbon credit and biodiversity conservation initiatives, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation REDD+. The decision framework can also be linked to species distribution models and socio-economic models to find restoration solutions that maximize simultaneously biodiversity, carbon stocks, and other ecosystem services across landscapes. Our study provides the foundation for developing and testing cost-effective and adaptable forest management rules to achieve biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and other socio-economic co-benefits under global change.},

  abstract = {Most forests today are multi-specific and heterogeneous forests (‘mixed forests’). However, forest modelling has been focusing on mono-specific stands for a long time, only recently have models been developed for mixed forests. Previous reviews of mixed forest modelling were restricted to certain categories of models only and were generally not considering application and suitability. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the models designed for or applied to modelling mixed forest growth and dynamics and to review the suitability of the different model types according to their intended purposes. The first part of the paper gives an overview of previous classifications, after which a new and overall classification scheme is presented. Next, the characteristics of the six modelling approaches that were distinguished are described: distance-dependent stand models, distribution models, average tree models, distance-dependent tree models, distance-independent tree models and gap models. All, except gap models, are close to mono-specific stands modelling approaches. The second part of the paper describes the main applications of these modelling approaches and presents a critical analysis of their suitability. Applications can be separated between growth and yield studies and forest dynamics simulation studies. Attention must be paid to recruitment sub-models, which appear to be inadequate in many models, but which highly influence the simulation outcome. All types of model were used as management tools. Stand level simulations fit the yield data better than tree level simulations, as a result of cumulated model errors from tree to stand level. However, tree level approaches seem most appropriate to understand stand growth as affected by competition between individuals of different species. Forest dynamics were mostly modelled using distribution models, gap models and distance-dependent tree models. The latter appeared to be less suitable because of the difficulties in modelling 3D stand structure over large periods and areas. Gap models could be applied to larger areas and time periods than distribution models, especially when they included detailed descriptions of the ecological functioning of the ecosystem. In sum the empirical models appeared more accurate in their predictions than mechanistic models, but they are highly dependent on the data used for parameterisation. That makes them unsuitable for extrapolation to other systems or conditions. Although mechanistic models can also be misused, adding mechanistic approaches to empirical observations is necessary to model the growth and dynamics of complex forest systems.},

The objectives of this synthesis are to assemble the existing knowledge about the system, clarify the terminology in use, and discuss its place in silviculture in northeastern North America. Irregular shelterwood is compared with other regeneration methods and we propose a classification based on three variants. This silvicultural system is compatible with ecosystem-based management in forest types driven by partial stand mortality and gap dynamics and provides opportunities for maintaining old-growth forest attributes. However, it presents important challenges, especially with regards to planning, growth and yield prediction, and operational application.},

  abstract = {Green-tree retention cutting (GTR) is a modification of traditional clear-cutting, aimed at better consideration of biodiversity. We reviewed 214 North American and European studies to answer whether, and under which circumstances, GTR meets its objectives: ‘lifeboats’ species over the regeneration phase, provides microhabitats for old-forest species in re-established forest stands and for disturbance-phase species on the recent cuts, and enhances species’ dispersal by increasing landscape connectivity. To answer these questions is complicated, partly because the target taxa differ regionally and due to research biases: 81\% of the studies have been carried out in North America, 82\% have been short term, and the objective of improving landscape connectivity has not been studied. A meta-analysis of GTR effects on species richness and abundance of different taxa indicated no negative responses, but birds and ectomycorrhizal fungi benefited most. Compared with clear-cutting, GTR lowered the harvest-related loss of populations or individuals in 72\% of studies, and it nearly always improved the habitat for disturbance-phase insects and birds on the cuts and for forest species in the regenerated stand. Lifeboating was most successful for ectomycorrhizal fungi, epiphytic lichens and small ground-dwelling animals, and least successful for bryophytes and vascular plants. Retention tree species always contributed to the success of GTR, followed by tree density (65\% of cases) and the spatial arrangement of the trees (50\%); the influence of forest type is likely, but insufficiently studied. Ectomycorrhizal fungi, epiphytes, birds, and wood-dependent beetles may be suitable indicator taxa for measuring the success of GTR. For future research, we encourage clearly objective oriented studies of relevant taxa, spatially explicit landscape perspectives, and long-term (including retrospective) studies.},

Over the past decade, ecologists have begun to incorporate two important tools for estimating diversity: coverage and Hill diversity. Coverage is a method for equalizing samples that is, on theoretical grounds, preferable to other commonly used methods such as equal-effort sampling, or rarefying datasets to equal sample size. Hill diversity comprises a spectrum of diversity metrics and is based on three key insights. First, species richness and variants of the Shannon and Simpson indices are all special cases of one general equation. Second, richness, Shannon and Simpson can be expressed on the same scale and in units of species. Third, there is no way to eliminate the effect of relative abundance from estimates of any of these diversity metrics, including species richness. Rather, a researcher must choose the relative sensitivity of the metric towards rare and common species, a concept which we describe as ‘leverage.' In this paper we explain coverage and Hill diversity, provide guidelines for how to use them together to measure species diversity, and demonstrate their use with examples from our own data. We show why researchers will obtain more robust results when they estimate the Hill diversity of equal-coverage samples, rather than using other methods such as equal-effort sampling or traditional sample rarefaction.},

  abstract = {The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) has been used for several decades as an explanation for the coexistence of species in ecological communities. It is intuitively simple, but deceptively so. We show, via discussion and examples, that the IDH is not one mechanism of coexistence, but rather summarizes a set of similar phenomena that can arise from the action of several different coexistence mechanisms. These underlying mechanisms are defined by the various ways in which species differ in their response to disturbance-induced spatial and temporal variability in resources and environmental conditions. As an example, the original specification of the IDH required patchy disturbances for coexistence. However, because the underlying mechanisms of coexistence can also operate at the within-patch scale, patchy disturbances are not a necessary requirement for coexistence under intermediate-disturbance regimes. These conclusions are illustrated through the analysis of three models: a spatial within-patch model, a spatial between-patch model, and a purely temporal model. All three generate similar patterns of coexistence under intermediate disturbance, yet underlying that coexistence lie at least two quite-distinct mechanisms of species coexistence: the storage effect and relative nonlinearity. The results from our analyses suggest that, as a promoter of species coexistence, the IDH is both broader in scope and richer in detail than has previously been recognized.},

  abstract = {For managed temperate forests, conservationists and policymakers favour fine-grained uneven-aged (UEA) management over more traditional coarse-grained even-aged (EA) management, based on the assumption that within-stand habitat heterogeneity enhances biodiversity. There is, however, little empirical evidence to support this assumption. We investigated for the first time how differently grained forest management systems affect the biodiversity of multiple above- and below-ground taxa across spatial scales. We sampled 15 taxa of animals, plants, fungi and bacteria within the largest contiguous beech forest landscape of Germany and classified them into functional groups. Selected forest stands have been managed for more than a century at different spatial grains. The EA (coarse-grained management) and UEA (fine-grained) forests are comparable in spatial arrangement, climate and soil conditions. These were compared to forests of a nearby national park that have been unmanaged for at least 20 years. We used diversity accumulation curves to compare γ-diversity for Hill numbers 0D (species richness), 1D (Shannon diversity) and 2D (Simpson diversity) between the management systems. Beta diversity was quantified as multiple-site dissimilarity. Gamma diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for at least one of the three Hill numbers for six taxa (up to 77\%), while eight showed no difference. Only bacteria showed the opposite pattern. Higher γ-diversity in EA forests was also found for forest specialists and saproxylic beetles. Between-stand β-diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for one-third (all species) and half (forest specialists) of all taxa, driven by environmental heterogeneity between age-classes, while α-diversity showed no directional response across taxa or for forest specialists. Synthesis and applications. Comparing EA and uneven-aged forest management in Central European beech forests, our results show that a mosaic of different age-classes is more important for regional biodiversity than high within-stand heterogeneity. We suggest reconsidering the current trend of replacing even-aged management in temperate forests. Instead, the variability of stages and stand structures should be increased to promote landscape-scale biodiversity.},

Most studies, however, have explored the potential and limits of structural measures to quantify forest structures by applying multiple measures to one stand or few measures to several stands. However, the interdependencies of multiple structural attributes across many stands of different forest management types and developmental stages have not yet been explored. Using 20 structural attributes and 124 completely inventoried 1ha sized stands we tested to what extent structural characteristics reflect different stand types and management intensities, and how these characteristics change over time. We found that single SSAs do not show the clear gradients that they were intended to reflect, suggesting that stand structure should be described by multiple structural attributes, and that these should represent different structural aspects (including vertical, and horizontal heterogeneity, density, and diversity). A principal component analysis showed that combining several SSAs, allowed us to distinguish between stand types. The structure of mature stands remained rather constant over the observed period of about 6 years, while that of young stands changed more rapidly due to ingrowth and mortality. The older the stands, the less the large trees contributed to stand growth relative to their size. We conclude that multiple stand structural attributes are needed to characterise stand types, management effects and to explain stand productivity.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the possible effects of tree species diversity and identity on the soil microbial community in a species-rich temperate broad-leaved forest. For the first time, we separated the effects of tree identity and tree species diversity on the link between above and belowground communities in a near-natural forest. We established 100 tree clusters consisting of each three tree individuals represented by beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), or lime (Tilia spec.) at two different sites in the Hainich National Park (Thuringia, Germany). The tree clusters included one, two or three species forming a diversity gradient. We investigated the microbial community structure, using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles, in mineral soil samples (0–10~cm) collected in the centre of each cluster. The lowest total PLFA amounts were found in the pure beech clusters (79.0~±~23.5~nmol~g−1 soil dw), the highest PLFA amounts existed in the pure ash clusters (287.3~±~211.3~nmol~g−1 soil dw). Using principle components analyses (PCA) and redundancy analyses (RDA), we found only for the variables ‘relative proportion of beech trees’ and ‘living lime fine root tips associated with ectomycorrhiza’ a significant effect on the PLFA composition. The microbial community structure was mainly determined by abiotic environmental parameters such as soil pH or clay content. The different species richness levels in the clusters did not significantly differ in their total PLFA amounts and their PLFA composition. We observed a tendency that the PLFA profiles of the microbial communities in more tree species-rich clusters were less influenced by individual PLFAs (more homogenous) than those from species-poor clusters. We concluded that tree species identity and site conditions were more important factors determining the soil microbial community structure than tree species diversity per se.},

  abstract = {Ongoing and future climate change may be of sufficient magnitude to significantly impact global forest ecosystems. In order to anticipate the potential range of changes to forests in the future and to better understand the development and state of forest ecosystems at present, a variety of forest ecosystem models of varying complexity have been developed over the past 40 years. While most of these models focus on representing either forest demographics including age and height structure, or forest biogeochemistry including plant physiology and ecosystem carbon cycling, it is increasingly seen as crucial that forest ecosystem models include equally good representations of both. However, only few models currently include detailed representations of both biogeochemistry and demographics, and those mostly have high computational demands. Here, we present TreeM-LPJ, a first step towards a new, computationally efficient forest dynamics model. We combine the height-class scheme of the forest landscape model TreeMig with the biogeochemistry of the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. The resulting model is able to simulate forest growth by considering vertical spatial variability without stochastic functions, considerably reducing computational demand. Discretization errors are kept small by using a numerical algorithm that extrapolates growth success in height, and thereby dynamically updates the state variables of the trees in the different height classes. We demonstrate TreeM-LPJ in an application on a transect in the central Swiss Alps where we show results from the new model compare favorably with the more complex LPJ-GUESS. TreeM-LPJ provides a combination of biological detail and computational efficiency that can serve as a useful basis for large-scale vegetation modeling.},

Species also vary in their regeneration success in gaps of different sizes. In this paper, the gap-phase interactions among tree species in a forest stand are simulated by a role-type stand model called ROPE. By incorporation of environmental effects on tree height, ROPE can simulate forest composition and stand leaf area under different climate conditions. The model was developed for forest ecosystems in northeastern China and was used to simulate the forest landscape structures under current climate conditions and under four climate change scenarios for greenhouse gas related warming. These scenarios were obtained from general circulation models developed by different atmospheric research centers. Korean pinebroadleaf mixed forest and larch forest are the major stand types in the study area under present conditions. Under the four climate change scenarios, Korean pine-broadleaf mixed forest would be expected to occur only on the higher parts of large mountains. Larch forest only would be found north of the study area. Broadleaf forest would become the dominant vegetation over the study area. Use of the Kappa statistic to test for similarity in spatial maps, indicates that each climate change scenario would result in a significant change of forest distributions.},

  abstract = {Sustainable ecosystem management aims to promote the structure and operation of the human components of the system while simultaneously ensuring the persistence of the structures and operation of the natural component. Given the complexity of this task owing to the diverse temporal and spatial scales and multidisciplinary interactions, a systems theory approach based on sound mathematical techniques is essential. Two important aspects of this approach are formulation of sustainability-based objectives and development of the management strategies. Fisher information can be used as the basis of a sustainability hypothesis to formulate relevant mathematical objectives for disparate systems, and optimal control theory provides the means to derive time-dependent management strategies. Partial correlation coefficient analysis is an efficient technique to identify the appropriate control variables for policy development. This paper represents a proof of concept for this approach using a model system that includes an ecosystem, humans, a very rudimentary industrial process, and a very simple agricultural system. Formulation and solution of the control problems help in identifying the effective management options which offer guidelines for policies in real systems. The results also emphasize that management using multiple parameters of different nature can be distinctly effective.},

  abstract = {Questions Tree species diversity is widely reported to positively influence forest productivity. Yet, a consistent attribution of productivity effects is complicated by the fact that compositional and structural diversity are often related in forest ecosystems. Here, our objective was to disentangle the effects of diversity in species and structures on forest productivity. We further assessed whether the influence of structure and composition on productivity changes over the course of forest development. Location Hainich National Park, central Germany. Methods We conducted a factorial simulation experiment in which 63 unique combinations of six different tree species were studied over 500 yr of forest development. The model used was iLand, a process-based simulator operating at individual tree resolution. The indicators of compositional diversity considered included species richness, entropy, evenness and identity, while structural diversity was characterized by indicators describing vertical and horizontal stand structure. Net primary production (NPP) was studied as the response variable, and random forest analysis was used to synthesize simulation output. Results We found positive effects of both compositional and structural diversity on productivity, but their influence changed distinctly over the course of forest development. In early-seral stages, diversity effects on NPP were dominated by aspects of tree species composition, and displayed a strong positive selection effect for European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). In later stages of forest development, diversity effects on NPP were dominated by structural diversity, with productivity increasing with increased variation in tree diameter and canopy complexity. Conclusion To better understand the effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning, both the compositional and structural dimensions of diversity in forest ecosystems (and their changes over time) need to be considered. In the context of ecosystem management our results suggest that the reduction in productivity associated with the loss of a canopy tree species (e.g. due to the invasion of an alien pest species) can to some degree be compensated through increased structural diversity. Fostering both compositional and structural diversity are important means to increase the robustness of forest ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Introduction:               ~Biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystems services are intrinsically dependent on the climate. During the twentieth century, climate change has posed major threats to biodiversity in Africa, and impacts are expected to increase as climate change continues and perhaps even accelerates.               Outcomes:               Our review shows that the multiple components of climate change are projected to affect all levels of biodiversity, from genes over species to biome level. Loss of biodiversity as a result of climate change can alter the structures and functions of African ecological systems. As a result, the provision of biodiversity-based ecosystem services and the well-being of people that rely on these services are being modified. Of particular concerns are “tipping points” where the exceedance of ecosystem thresholds will possibly lead to irreversible shifts of the structure of ecosystems and their services. In recent years, climate prediction models have portended continued warming and more frequent extreme weather events across the region. Such weather-related disturbances such as El Niño will place a premium on biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem services that people rely on.               Conclusion:               As biodiversity underlies all goods and services provided by ecosystems that are crucial for human survival and well-being, this paper synthesizes and discusses observed and anticipated impacts of climate change on biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem service provision and livelihoods, and what strategies might be employed to decrease current and future risks on the well-being of human in Africa.},

  abstract = {As our view of disturbances such as wildfire has shifted from prevention to recognizing their ecological necessity, so too forest management has evolved from timber-focused even-aged management to more holistic paradigms like ecosystem-based management. Emulation of natural disturbance (END) is a variant of ecosystem management that recognizes the importance of disturbance for maintaining ecological integrity. For END to be a successful model for forest management we need to describe disturbance regimes and implement management actions that emulate them, in turn achieving our objectives for forest structure and function. We review the different components of fire regimes (cause, frequency, extent, timing, and magnitude), we describe low-, mixed-, and high-severity fire regimes, and we discuss key issues related to describing these regimes. When characterizing fire regimes, different methods and spatial and temporal extents result in wide variation of estimates for different fire regime components. Comparing studies is difficult as few measure the same components; some methods are based on the assumption of a high-severity fire regime and are not suited to detecting mixed- or low-severity regimes, which are critical to END management, as this would affect retention in harvested areas. We outline some difficulties with using fire regimes as coarse filters for forest management, including (i) not fully understanding the interactions between fire and other disturbance agents, (ii) assuming that fire is strictly an exogenous disturbance agent that exerts top-down control of forest structure while ignoring numerous endogenous and bottom-up feedbacks on fire effects, and (iii) assuming by only replicating natural disturbance patterns we preserve ecological processes and vital ecosystem components. Even with a good understanding of a fire regime, we would still be challenged with choosing the temporal and spatial scope for the disturbance regime we are trying to emulate. We cannot yet define forest conditions that will arise from variations in disturbance regime; this then limits our ability to implement management actions that will achieve those conditions. We end by highlighting some important knowledge gaps about fire regimes and how the END model could be strengthened to achieve a more sustainable form of forest management.},

To this end, we determined the effects of the tree species composition on the biomass and composition of the soil microbial community using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles in the Hainich National Park, a deciduous mixed forest on loess over limestone in Central-Germany. We investigated the effects of the leaf litter composition on the microbial community, hypothesizing that distinctive leaf litter compositions increase signature PLFAs. In addition, we studied the impact of clay content, pH and nutrient status of the soil on the microbial community in different surface soil layers. Consequently, soil was sampled from depths of 0–5~cm, 5–10~cm and 10–20~cm. Plots with highest leaf litter diversity had the largest total amounts of fatty acids, but only PLFA 16:1ω5, which is a common marker for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, was significantly increased. In the uppermost soil layer, the pH explained most of the variance in microbial composition. In the deeper surface soil layers, nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus determined the microbial abundances and composition. Our results suggest that the soil microbial community is mainly indirectly influenced by aboveground diversity. Changes in soil pH or the soil nutrient status that are driven by specific plant traits like leave litter quality drive these indirect changes. Specific direct interactions are most reasonable for mycorrhizal fungi.},

Empirical mortality algorithms (MAs) are often considered promising, but little is known about DVM robustness when employing MAs of various structures and origins for multiple species. We analysed empirical MAs for a suite of European tree species within a consistent DVM framework under present and future climates in two climatically different study areas in Switzerland and evaluated their performance using empirical data from old-growth forests across Europe. DVM projections under present climate showed substantial variations when using alternative empirical MAs for the same species. Under climate change, DVM projections showed partly contrasting mortality responses for the same species. These opposing patterns were associated with MA structures (i.e. explanatory variables) and occurred independent of species ecological characteristics. When comparing simulated forest structure with data from old-growth forests, we found frequent overestimations of basal area, which can lead to flawed projections of carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services. While using empirical MAs in DVMs may appear promising, our results emphasize the importance of selecting them cautiously. We therefore synthesize our insights into a guideline for the appropriate use of empirical MAs in DVM applications.},

  abstract = {The relationships between biodiversity and stability were determined for both population and ecosystem traits in a long—term study of 207 grassland plots. Results demonstrate that biodiversity stabilizes community and ecosystem processes, but not population processes. Specifically, year—to—year variability in total aboveground plant community biomass was significantly lower in plots with greater plant species richness both for the entire 11—yr period and for the nine non—drought years. The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability. In contrast, year—to—year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non—drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable. These results support both the predictions of Robert May concerning the effects of diversity on population stability and the diversity—stability hypothesis as applied to community and ecosystem processes, thus helping to reconcile a long—standing dispute.},

However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are poorly understood, especially in natural ecosystems. We develop a novel approach to partition biodiversity effects on multifunctionality into three mechanisms and apply this to European forest data. We show that throughout Europe, tree diversity is positively related with multifunctionality when moderate levels of functioning are required, but negatively when very high function levels are desired. For two well-known mechanisms, ‘complementarity’ and ‘selection’, we detect only minor effects on multifunctionality. Instead a third, so far overlooked mechanism, the ‘jack-of-all-trades’ effect, caused by the averaging of individual species effects on function, drives observed patterns. Simulations demonstrate that jack-of-all-trades effects occur whenever species effects on different functions are not perfectly correlated, meaning they may contribute to diversity–multifunctionality relationships in many of the world’s ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Significance             A major advance of the last 20 y at the interface of biological, environmental, and conservation sciences has been the demonstration that plant biodiversity positively influences ecosystem function. Linking these results to applied conservation efforts hinges on the assumption that biodiversity is actually declining at the local scale at which diversity–function relationships are strongest. Our compilation and analysis of a global database of {$>$}16,000 repeat survey vegetation plots from habitats across the globe directly contradict this assumption. We find no general tendency for local-scale plant species diversity to decline over the last century, calling into question the widespread use of ecosystem function experiments to argue for the importance of biodiversity conservation in nature.           ,              Global biodiversity is in decline. This is of concern for aesthetic and ethical reasons, but possibly also for practical reasons, as suggested by experimental studies, mostly with plants, showing that biodiversity reductions in small study plots can lead to compromised ecosystem function. However, inferring that ecosystem functions will decline due to biodiversity loss in the real world rests on the untested assumption that such loss is actually occurring at these small scales in nature. Using a global database of 168 published studies and {$>$}16,000 nonexperimental, local-scale vegetation plots, we show that mean temporal change in species diversity over periods of 5–261 y is not different from zero, with increases at least as likely as declines over time. Sites influenced primarily by plant species’ invasions showed a tendency for declines in species richness, whereas sites undergoing postdisturbance succession showed increases in richness over time. Other distinctions among studies had little influence on temporal richness trends. Although maximizing diversity is likely important for maintaining ecosystem function in intensely managed systems such as restored grasslands or tree plantations, the clear lack of any general tendency for plant biodiversity to decline at small scales in nature directly contradicts the key assumption linking experimental results to ecosystem function as a motivation for biodiversity conservation in nature. How often real world changes in the diversity and composition of plant communities at the local scale cause ecosystem function to deteriorate, or actually to improve, remains unknown and is in critical need of further study.},

  abstract = {Background Despite empirical support for an increase in ecosystem productivity with species diversity in synthetic systems, there is ample evidence that this relationship is dependent on environmental characteristics, especially in structurally more complex natural systems. Empirical support for this relationship in forests is urgently needed, as these ecosystems play an important role in carbon sequestration. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested whether tree wood production is positively related to tree species richness while controlling for climatic factors, by analyzing 55265 forest inventory plots in 11 forest types across five European countries. On average, wood production was 24\% higher in mixed than in monospecific forests. Taken alone, wood production was enhanced with increasing tree species richness in almost all forest types. In some forests, wood production was also greater with increasing numbers of tree types. Structural Equation Modeling indicated that the increase in wood production with tree species richness was largely mediated by a positive association between stand basal area and tree species richness. Mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation affected wood production and species richness directly. However, the direction and magnitude of the influence of climatic variables on wood production and species richness was not consistent, and vary dependent on forest type. Conclusions Our analysis is the first to find a local scale positive relationship between tree species richness and tree wood production occurring across a continent. Our results strongly support incorporating the role of biodiversity in management and policy plans for forest carbon sequestration.},

  abstract = {Many managed northern hardwood forests are characterized by low-diversity tree regeneration. Small harvest gaps, competition from shrub–herb vegetation, and browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) contribute to this pattern, but we know little about how these factors interact. With a stand-scale experiment, we examined the effects of gap size (0–3234 m2), vegetation (weeded:unweeded), and deer (fenced:unfenced) on seedling growth and survival for 18 tree species. With increasing gap size and light, shrub–herb vegetation density increased, while deer browsing on seedlings in unweeded plots decreased. Fenced:weeded seedlings of all species increased in height up to 35–45\% light, with optimal growth in large-group selection and patch cut harvest gaps. Height growth rank order among tree species changed between gap sizes, but growth varied little in small, low-light gaps. Instead, a low-light survival (i.e., shade tolerance) vs. high-light growth tradeoff we observed is likely more important for species sorting of gap sizes. Shrub–herb vegetation decreased seedling survival and growth, especially in larger harvest gaps, shifting gap size optima to smaller gaps, but had little effect on growth/survival rank order among species. In contrast, deer had strong impacts on growth rank order, especially in larger gaps where species differences in growth potential were trumped by differences in deer browsing pressure responses. However, contrary to their consistently negative main effects, vegetation and deer had two positive interacting effects: dense shrub–herb vegetation in large gaps protected seedlings of faster-growing species from browsing and deer browsing of shrub–herb vegetation modestly increased light and growth of short, suppressed, browsing-avoided species. In summary, harvest gap size-mediated light availability, shrub–herb vegetation, and deer herbivory had strong interacting effects on tree seedling interspecific performance ranks and intraspecific optimal gap sizes. For management, a broad range of harvest gap sizes and rapid establishment of tree regeneration (naturally or planted) to minimize shrub–herb competition should increase tree diversity in forests with few deer. However, with deer browsing pressure, a more limited set of lesser-browsed species are likely to recruit successfully regardless of gap size, except in large patch cut gaps, where recruitment of faster-growing, shade-intolerant species is possible.},

In this contribution an indicator system is proposed to measure natural diversity (relief, soils, waters), cultural diversity (main land use classes, diversity of land use, ecotones, connectivity) and anthropogenic impacts (fragmentation, hemeroby, protection). The contribution gives an overview of various indicators on landscape diversity and heterogeneity currently used in Germany and Europe. Based on these indicators a complementary system, is presented. The indicators introduced here are derived from regular evaluations of the digital basis landscape model (Basic DLM) of the Authoritative Topographic-Cartographic Information System (ATKIS), the digital land cover model for Germany (LBM-DE) as well as other supplementary data such as the mapping of potential natural vegetation. With the proposed indicators it is possible to estimate cumulative land-use change and its impact on the environmental status and biodiversity, so that existing indicator systems are supplemented with meaningful additional information. Investigations have shown that indicators on forest fragmentation, hemeroby or ecotones can be derived from official geodata. As such geodata is regularly updated, trends in indicator values can be quickly identified. Large regional differences in the distribution of the proposed indicators have been confirmed, thereby revealing deficits and identifying those regions with a high potential for biodiversity. The indicators will be successively integrated into the web-based land-use monitor (http://www.ioer-monitor.de), which is freely available for public use.},

  abstract = {Declines in the diversity of herbaceous and woody plant species in the understory of eastern North American hardwood forests are increasingly common. Forest managers are tasked with maintaining and/or promoting species diversity and resilience; however, the success of these efforts depends on a robust understanding of past and future system dynamics and identification and application of appropriate silvicultural interventions. We review how historical timber harvesting and land use, increases in deer population sizes, invasive species, and contemporary forest management practices interact to erode ecological memory and increase resilience debt of hardwood forests of eastern North America. The erosion of ecological memory and growing resilience debt in these forests pose significant challenges for forest managers because they alter the response of forests to management from the understory to overstory. Differences in how much ecological memory these systems retain, as well as the mosaic of interacting factors influencing contemporary dynamics, preclude a one size fits all management approach. That being said, our review has identified a host of common factors and pathways that can be manipulated. The approach we propose requires a more thoughtful understanding of the forest understory as the foundation upon which resilient systems are built. Which silvicultural levers will have the greatest utility clearly depend on the ecological context of the forest, and a willingness to experiment and adapt. We offer a conceptual model and recommendations for managers confronting novel plant communities and uncertain system dynamics.},

  abstract = {Associational resistance, which refers to decreased herbivory experienced by a plant growing with heterospecific neighbors, is a well documented ecological phenomenon. In contrast, studies that describe increased herbivory due to heterospecific neighbors (associational susceptibility) are relatively rare. In this study we document associational susceptibility among hosts of the fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria). Cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia × P. fremontii) located under box elder (Acer negundo) were colonized by two to three times more cankerworms, and suffered two to three times greater defoliation than cottonwoods growing under mature cottonwoods, or cottonwoods growing in the open. This associational pattern reflects fall cankerworm's strong preference for box elder over cottonwood: egg densities were 26 times greater on box elder than cottonwood, first instar larvae consumed 75 times more box elder than cottonwood in larval palatability trials, and fourth instar larvae consumed three times more box elder than cottonwood. In terms of larval performance, first instar larvae exhibited approximately six times greater mortality and 40\% slower development time on cottonwood relative to box elder, whereas fourth instar larval performance did not differ between the hosts. Based on these and other findings, we predict that, when generalist herbivores reach outbreak proportions and consume their preferred hosts, they will then move to nearby less-preferred hosts to complete their life cycle. This “spillover” effect will result in associational susceptibility for less-preferred hosts and is likely common in forest outbreak situations where herbivore densities are high. With increased emphasis on diversified plantings in agriculture and forestry, it is important to understand potential drawbacks such as associational susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Background: Twelve distinct explanations have been proposed for the co-existence of species in ecological communities. Types of mechanism: The mechanisms can be divided into those that are stabilizing, i.e. with an increase-when-rare mechanism, and those that are equalizing, the latter on their own only delaying the exclusion of species. However, by evening out fitness, equalizing mechanisms can facilitate the operation of stabilizing mechanisms. Importance: It is suggested that circular interference networks, co-evolution of similar interference ability, cyclic succession, equal chance (neutrality) and initial patch composition are likely to be unimportant, or perhaps not even occur. Equal chance is an equalizing mechanism. Allogenic disturbance, alpha-niche differentiation, environmental fluctuation (relative non-linearity and/or the storage effect) and pest pressure are probably important. All four are stabilizing. More evidence is needed on aggregation, interference/dispersal trade-offs and the spatial mass effect. Aggregation and the spatial mass effect are equalizing. Suggestions are made of the evidence needed to make informed judgements on which contribute the most to co-existence in plant communities.},

  abstract = {Light competition and interspecific differences in shade tolerance are considered key determinants of forest stand structure and dynamics. Specifically two main stand diameter distribution types as a function of shade tolerance have been proposed based on empirical observations. All-aged stands of shade tolerant species tend to have steeply descending, monotonic diameter distributions (inverse J-shaped curves). Shade intolerant species in contrast typically exhibit normal (unimodal) tree diameter distributions due to high mortality rates of smaller suppressed trees. In this study we explore the generality of this hypothesis which implies a causal relationship between light competition or shade tolerance and stand structure. For this purpose we formulate a partial differential equation system of stand dynamics as a function of individual tree growth, recruitment and mortality which allows us to explore possible individual-based mechanisms—e.g. light competition—underlying observed patterns of stand structure—e.g. unimodal or inverse J-shaped equilibrium diameter curves. We find that contrary to expectations interspecific differences in growth patterns can result alone in any of the two diameter distributions types observed in the field. In particular, slow growing species can present unimodal equilibrium curves even in the absence of light competition. Moreover, light competition and shade intolerance evaluated both at the tree growth and mortality stages did not have a significant impact on stand structure that tended to converge systematically towards an inverse J-shaped curves for most tree growth scenarios. Realistic transient stand dynamics for even aged stands of shade intolerant species (unimodal curves) were only obtained when recruitment was completely suppressed, providing further evidence on the critical role played by juvenile stages of tree development (e.g. the sapling stage) on final forest structure and composition. The results also point out the relevance of partial differential equations systems as a tool for exploring the individual-level mechanisms underpinning forest structure, particularly in relation to more complex forest simulation models that are more difficult to analyze and to interpret from a biological point of view.},

  abstract = {Mechanistic theories of plant competition developed to explain changes in community structure and dynamics along resource availability gradients have been mostly applied to temperate forests and grasslands where light and nutrients are the two main limiting resources. In contrast, the mechanisms underlying the structure and dynamics of water-limited plant communities have been little explored. Also previous mechanistic models rely either on complex simulators, which are difficult to interpret or on simple conceptual models, which ignore too many critical details. In this study, we develop a model of stand dynamics for light and water-limited forests of intermediate complexity and we provide an analytical framework for its analyses. The model is an individual-based simulator that describes the feedback between transpiration, stomatal function and soil water dynamics with asymmetrical competition for light and water. Trees allocate carbon to three main compartments: shoot, stem and roots. We use the model to explore general patterns that may emerge across levels of biological organization from the leaf to the stand. Model predictions are consistent with a number of features of Mediterranean forests structure and dynamics. At the plant-level the leaf-based tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss expresses as a tradeoff between mortality and growth. This tradeoff explains plant morphological changes in above-ground biomass and root to shoot allocation along a water availability gradient. At the community-level, tradeoffs among carbon acquisition and water loss govern the sign of plant interactions along the gradient. Coexistence among morphological types was not observed for the range of parameters and environmental conditions explored. Overall the model provides an unifying explanation for the observed changes in the sign of plant to plant interactions along environmental gradients as well as a process-based formulation that can be linked to empirical studies.},

  abstract = {The accelerated loss of biological diversity is causing concern, for this reason its preservation has emerged as an objective in forest management. Extending conservation methods to managed lands is problematic. Biological diversity is a complex concept that includes many different aspects of ecosystems, therefore an operational measure of biodiversity is unlikely to be found. In addition, its relationship with stability and resilience has been a subject of long debate in ecology and remains confusing. We review the existing approaches for the conservation of biological diversity. Most of them are derived from population biology and emphasize the species richness component of biological diversity. These methods do not account for ecosystem processes and economical constraints which make them inappropriate for implementation in managed lands. On the other hand, forestry and ecology have historically evolved independently and makes the understanding between managers and ecologists even more difficult. We propose four directions for further research that would help to couple forestry and ecology showing one example (Pacific Northwest) in which considerable research efforts have been made making forestry and conservation compatible. In the other example provided (Mediterranean basin), we show that a certain level of management is required for the preservation of biological diversity. Since it is urgent to take action, methods for conservation biology play a key role as first approaches, but alone are not sufficient to account for the preservation of diversity in managed lands and should be complemented with alternative approaches that account for economical constraints and ecosystem level processes.},
